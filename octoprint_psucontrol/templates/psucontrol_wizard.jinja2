<h2>PSU Control</h2>
<p>Starting with PSU Control version 1.0.0 RPi.GPIO has been dropped in favor of Python-Periphery. For the majority of users there should be no difference, but please be sure to <font color="red">fully test your config before proceeding!</font></p>
<p>If you would like to continue using RPi.GPIO there is good news! PSU Control now supports plugins and RPi.GPIO is one of them. You can install <b>PSU Control - RPi.GPIO</b> from the plugin manager.</p>
